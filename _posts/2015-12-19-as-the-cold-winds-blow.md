as the cold winds blow 

Frost 
sprinkled across the fields,
whose flowers are no more.
Nature's abundance yields,
but different than before.
A haunted setting,
to look upon,
a time of soulful forgetting,
in solitude withdrawn.
But the sun still shines,
and the grasses still grow
in ever advancing designs,
as the cold winds blow.
