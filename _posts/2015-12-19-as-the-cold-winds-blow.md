Frost 
sprinkled across the fields,
whose flowers are no more. 

Nature's abundance yields,
but different than before. 

A haunted setting,
to look upon, 

a time of soulful forgetting, 

in solitude withdrawn. 

But the sun still shines, 

and the grasses still grow 

in ever advancing designs, 

as the cold winds blow.
