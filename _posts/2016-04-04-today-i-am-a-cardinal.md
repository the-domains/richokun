_Just before dawn,_

_a very noisy scene,_

_took place on the lawn, _

_braking up our daily routine._

Today, I was a Cardinal - rich okun

_What a ruckus this morning,_

_when without any warning,_

_and with no relief, or surcease,_

_a bluejay disturbed the peace._

__

__

_Then, from out of nowhere,_

_dashed a brilliant-bright red._

_And from this tussled pair,_

_feathers everywhere were spread,_

__

__

_With his lover's nest so close,_

_the Cardinal would have none of that._

_The Bluejay turned white as a ghost,_

_after being shown where its at._

__

__

_I put my Jacket on to keep me warm_

_then for a puppy-run, to keep good form._

__

__

_While walking in the park,_

_I heard a faint hawk cry,_

_my puppy started to bark, _

_when I saw a bluejay nearby._

__

__

_Betrayed the culprit behind_

_the call that wasn't true,_

_not from who it was designed,_

_(with a dash of royal blue)._

__

__

_Clever little fellow,_

_with trickery and deceit,_

_wanted to disrupt_

_the mellow,_

_and the Red-Robin's_

_family retreat._

__

__

_On the ground,_

_the Robin nervously pacing,_

_bobbing up and down,_

_her troubled heart was racing._

__

__

_So I clapped my hands,_

_and the Bluejay flew away._

_Grateful, the Robin lands, _

_on her nested hideaway._

__

__

_As I brushed off my overcoat_

_I noticed;_

_it was brilliant-bright red._

_'Just like this morning's Cardinal,_

_an antidote_

_to the commotion'- I said._

__

__

_It was then, I knew_

_that a single thread,_

_runs through all things._

_Oh,_

_to be mystically fed,_

_by the King of Kings._
