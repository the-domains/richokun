When you feel the need

to freshen

and renew,

just remember this expression;

and Do-be, Do-be, Do.

Creative rhythms, 

to spiritual laws uphold,

neither trifle or 'isms',

nor bought or sold.

I will meet you

at that place,

the intersection

of what is,

and can possibly be.

A sacred space, 

on the edge

of the formed and formless,

and whatever choices,

I make of me.

And then, if the seeker

no longer asks the question,

'when is two really one?',

into the body and mind,

will come a suggestion,

to rest,

that for now,

your journey is done.
