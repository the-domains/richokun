Where might you be today, had you begun your spiritual journey when you were very young? What if you could find it easy to discuss topics of the spiritual dimensions of life with your child or grandchild, thereby enhancing your relationships? What possibilities open for you when you can look beyond the limited view we tend to have? 

Our lives are bombarded with things that can take us away from the special connections we are capable of. Each of us has the ability to demonstrate love, compassion, gratitude, and generosity. We can choose to live our lives by the Golden Rule. We can make time to appreciate the exquisite construction of our planet and experience the joys of nature. We can look toward the star-spangled heavens, appreciate the velvet silence, and draw peace from spirituality. We have the ability to find beauty in simplicity, and we can marvel at the complexity of what, at first glance, may appear deceptively simple. Many of us have just forgotten how.
In today's busy, electronics-oriented world, dominated by distractions, special effects, and noisy shoot-'em-ups, simple earth-based spiritual and moral issues have been effectively obscured from view and buried in the smoky haze of the fiery explosion of computer-generated images. 

The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and Maya was created to help families discuss important issues with their children. Illustrations of Maya, the Shih Tzu puppy muse, in complementary settings, accompany bits of wisdom relating to spiritual and moral issues. Notable quotations are the inspiration for Maya's simple-language lyrical interpretations meant to evoke awe and wonder in all things and capture the imagination of the child and the child within the parent. 

As this book came together, I pondered my own childhood, my own upbringing, my own relationships with my parents, grandparents and other family members, and the ways in which exploring the mystical questions of the spiritual might have impacted my life.
Looking around at families today, I see how difficult it can be to be able to have meaningful conversations that must compete for time and attention with the short sound bite-sized action-packed commercial menagerie and other challenging ways of being in our current societal environment. I wondered how much closer to my parents might I have been, what choices might I have made in careers, hobbies, people and other interests. 

The answers to these questions sparked my courage to write and publish this book. Healing comes from within, and can benefit from stimulation of thoughts to feelings to manifestation. The subjects covered in these books are universal in their appeal and curiosity -- They ask the questions we all have. We all know the answers, but they remain hidden from us, until further questioning helps them to come out to the light.
The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and Maya is richly textured with over 85 quotes along with lyrical interpretations and over 90 full color illustrations making it a perfect companion for your child or for you when there are times of need or exploration. It also makes for the perfect gift for your grandchild or a family you know that could use more quality time with their children. With your purchase of either the printed or electronic versions, you are also given access to a private website that provides all the illustrations in hi-resolution downloadable format as well as audio readings of the quotes/poems and much much more.
