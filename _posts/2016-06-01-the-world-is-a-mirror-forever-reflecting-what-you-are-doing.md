The world is a mirror, forever reflecting what you are doing within yourself. - Neville Goddard.

Wherever is your heart,

so do you express

with choices you impart,

and upon your soul impress.

Can the senses look

inside your heart?

My foundations shook

when I read Descartes.

Now go and share

your inner key,

it will make you aware

of all you can't see.

In your world appears 

from what you really are;

now break new frontiers,

and raise the bar.
