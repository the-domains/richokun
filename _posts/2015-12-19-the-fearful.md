We are human beings, and as such are verbs, a set of processes, not a noun. How terrible must it be
to live in fear all the time.
To always be angry,
everything's a mountain to climb.
The fearful;
love to puff up their chest,
to project and complain,
but never address,
just play victim and blame
and then shamefully shame.
I really don't understand
how blind, can blind be.
Society must countermand
and re-find its sanity.
