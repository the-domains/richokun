I was out for a walk 
with my dog, 

when I came upon 
a very big frog. 

He was the biggest frog 
I'd ever seen, 

and although only 
a little green, 

he treated me to the
best greet that has ever been. 

And when we went on our way, 

from then on and everyday, 

I was the best greeting machine 

the world has ever seen.
