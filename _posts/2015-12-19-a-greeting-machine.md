a greeting machine

I was out for a walk 
with my dog,
when I came upon 
a very big frog.
He was the biggest frog 
I'd ever seen,
and although only 
a little green,
he treated me to the
best greet that has ever been.
And when we went on our way,
from then on and everyday,
I was the best greeting machine
the world has ever seen.
