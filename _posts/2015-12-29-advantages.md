It is the greatest of all advantages to enjoy no advantage at all. - Henry David Thoreau 
Some, 
place great importance in having the upper hand. always needing to advance, 
and having to be in command.
 But 
there is something to be said, 
and the greater to be gained, 
to not be so far ahead, 
rather be equal and contained. 
A great humility
is invited,
when equanimity
is highlighted.
In receptive presence
of guided wisdom,
a perceptive resonance
to express your 'ism'.
