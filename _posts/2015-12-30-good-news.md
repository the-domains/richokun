The bad news is nothing lasts forever, The good news is nothing lasts forever. - J. Cole. 

Feeling mighty fine, good news arrived. 

Naysay all that I may but it's just a shuck n jive. 

You know, all that distracting talk 

and meaningless chitter-chatter-squawk. 

I think I'll keep swimming, 

in the substance of dreams. 

My good fortune's brimming, 

my cup runneth over it seems.
