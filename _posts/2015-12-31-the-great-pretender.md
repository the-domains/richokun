Silly me
I thought I had to 
force my way in.
That I had to 
break the door down,
not knowing 
that its always open,
and its not a verb, 
its a noun. 

I would see that door,
in shadowy contour.
Just slightly ajar.
And many times before,
I'd get close, but no cigar. 

Unaware, that;
waiting in the dream, 
for the dreamer to accept,
is his role 
in this grand scheme.
Waiting so patiently, 
where certainty is kept. 

From here to the other side, 
we can try to hide,
but through love you'll surrender
and no matter how well alibied,  it will unmask the great pretender.
