A noise, this morning

at the break of dawn.

Where did it come from,

in the house or the lawn?

Then, I saw you

sauntering on by,

a certain look

in everyone's eye.

Heard your heart

as you silently spoke

an awareness you impart,

its message I uncloak.

Its meaning sent,

by ways unknown, 

asks a feverent consent,

in such a poignant tone.

"We won't bother you,

and we'll be no trouble,

but if you feel that we do,

we'll be gone on the double."

"Me casa es tu casa"

came into my mind,

and without a doubt,

so divinely divined.

so now

gone the fear

for under the house

there's a family to rear.
