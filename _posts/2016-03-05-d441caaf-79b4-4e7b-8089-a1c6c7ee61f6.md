"To live is so startling, it leaves little time for anything else." - Emily Dickinson

except discovery....

I'm alive.

and not just here

to survive

or live in fear.

Am I not yet convinced

of my part

in divinity?

Isn't my body deeply 

rinsed

in the waters

of infinity?

Isn't a oneness that I now see

really in all,

with affinity?

That which is sought

was never outside.

A feeling, a thought,

as the ancients described.
