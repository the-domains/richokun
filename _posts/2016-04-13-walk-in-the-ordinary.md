You walk

in the ordinary,

in the mundane

and the everyday.

In the routine,

and the necessary,

molding your

potter's clay.

With not,

a whimper or a bang,

not a cheer or a boo,

not a yin or a yang,

it just happens to you.

Something deep inside,

awakens and knows,

the secrets of creation,

and how life really goes.
