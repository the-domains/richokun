_If friends were flowers, I'd pick you - Albert Camus_

_When 2 souls join_

_it matters not their difference_

_a true phrase to coin_

_if you can get the inference._

_there's a place_

_where the joining is done_

_where the two embrace_

_and can act as one_

_you will know you're there_

_when the differences don't matter_

_when you are one of an unlikely pair_

_and the paradigms just shatter_
