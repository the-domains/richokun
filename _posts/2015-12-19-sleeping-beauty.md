sleeping beauty

When I 
look upon the face
of a sleeping beauty,
its illumined grace,
is all that I see.
A pureness in peace,
whose tenderness is felt,
piercing my outer shell,
my heart begins to melt.
It doesn't really matter
the what or who, because
without awakened chatter
its ascension of all that was. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1ad732f6-baba-49ff-a15f-a018c7caf1da.jpg)
