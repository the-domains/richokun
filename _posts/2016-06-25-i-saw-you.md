I saw you

in the glint

of that hummingbird's eye.

It took me by surprise,

but I could not deny.

Then;

I saw you again,

in a drop of dew.

A sparkle grew

to a rainbow

on a pedal from you.

I saw you again

and again,

and then,

I realized

you are everywhere

and everything

and if I dare

I can see you there.
