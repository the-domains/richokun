I stare, into the knowing 
of an ageless essence,
only aware,
by my coming and going
in a child like innocence. 
I sense in each flower 
the infinite unchanging.
Though my senses will devour
the illusions they're arranging.
For that 
which arises in time,
ends in time,
and in between,
what is true for me,
expresses, externally.
My eyes 
will challenge,
in heated negotiation, 
my nose 
smells and measures,
each fragrant deviation,
and my soul, 
will sense in the world,
the whole,
of creation.
