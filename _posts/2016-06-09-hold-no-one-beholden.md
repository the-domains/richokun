# hold no one beholden
![the golden rule](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bdd000fd-d2e3-4677-b669-c78a901aa43d.jpg)

In a world of

me vs. not me,

competition is king

so the animal in you

overcomes everything.

But a much better rule

that's timeless,

and so damn cool

it shines golden.

Give,

and hold nothing

and no one beholden.
