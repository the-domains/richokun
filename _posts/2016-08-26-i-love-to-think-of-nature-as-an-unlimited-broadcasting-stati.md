I love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station, through which God speaks to us every hour, if we will only tune in. - George Washington Carver

Nature said;

'look deep

past my red

and wake

from your sleep,

feel my heartbeat,

hear my wings hum,

a fragrance so sweet,

just watch me become

the substance of dreams,

the content of desire,

life's rhythmic themes,

frees this bird on a wire.'
