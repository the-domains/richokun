A blanket of autumn leaves, 

in shades of orange and brown. 

Falling as red, yellow, and green, 

they harden on the ground. 

From countless trees 

within my limited view, 

an infinite number of leaves 

transform color and hue.

And as I stand before
this inspiring sight to behold, 

once found, I must follow 
this mystical path of gold.
