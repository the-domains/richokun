What-where, who-how, when and why, am I?

Am I some idea,

whose time has come,

ever expanding and expressing,

the mind I'm from?

Communicating,

in symbolic gestures,

like words on a page

that come to life.

Actors on a stage,

in fulfillment or contraction,

make meaningful my reaction.

Could I be,

one with God?

That part of me

firmly planted on the sod?

Or if I ask who?

Am I just another you?

Can where and when,

be here and now?

and is why then,

the truth I allow?

Am I the warrior

and romancer?

Am I the question

and the answer?

Yes I Am.
