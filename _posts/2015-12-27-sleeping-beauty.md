When I 
look upon the face 

of a sleeping beauty, 

its illumined grace, 

is all that I see. 

A pureness in peace, 

whose tenderness is felt, 

piercing my outer shell, 

my heart begins to melt. 

It doesn't really matter 

the what or who, 

because
without awakened chatter 

its ascension of all that was. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5679df4e-4156-43e7-afb7-cf2a2fbe5e50.jpg)
