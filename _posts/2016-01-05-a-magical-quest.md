"Dive into your heart center. Sit in the silence. Desire self-realization with all your heart, with all your mind, and all your soul. Everything will take care of itself." - Robert Adams

Is there anything

more beautiful

than a dream,

that is well expressed, 

and becoming? 

Its a magical quest,

with reality succumbing 

to an effortless molding            

and the present 

so perfectly unfolding?
