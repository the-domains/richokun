_The Dance of the Cottonwood_

_Each year,_

_from one,_

_ten thousand thousands come._

_Seeds,_

_divinely fantasied,_

_to shake up the humdrum._

_Shadows cast tall_

_upon the ground._

_Seedlings free fall_

_without a sound._

_Caught in a glance, _

_at once its made,_

_an orchestrated dance,_

_so deftly displayed. _

_Against a backdrop_

_of green,_

_in the body of Spring,_

_a snowy wintery scene,_

_all surrounding,_

_takes wing._

_From my window's sights_

_I see a ballerina dance,_

_among the dotted whites,_

_of the cottonwood seeds advance._

_Their chaos gently soften,_

_to the winds calming force._

_I don't see this very often,_

_drawn ever closer,_

_to the source._
