from my spirit I belong

In silent contemplation

a friend comes along.

It doesn't matter my location,

'cause from spirit I belong.

With my eyes tightly closed,

whatever angels I seek,

behind eyelids, superimposed,

as mystical signs bespeak.

And your world responds

to the passions you feel.

The inner you, corresponds,

and you live that real deal.
