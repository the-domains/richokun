In Divine Fashion

It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon   
Articulated in
divine fashion,
first,
live in desire,
until 
your passion 
catches fire.
Then, 
spare no ration,
merely live 
that inspired desire.
And,
if you falter
worry not,
just return and alter 
to the love you forgot.
