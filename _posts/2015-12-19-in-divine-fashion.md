It is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to fear. - Francis Bacon ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/536bb101e7a64899dd4b314833a2afc2b0bf7b94.jpg)

Articulated in
divine fashion, 

first, 

live in desire, 

until 
your passion 
catches fire. 

Then, 

spare no ration, 

merely live 
that inspired desire. 

And, 

if you falter 

worry not,  

just return and alter 

to the love you forgot.
